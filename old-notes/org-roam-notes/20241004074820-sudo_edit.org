* sudo edit with vim and respect env vars

We can edit a file with ~sudo~, but then vim, nvim, emacs, and other
editors will not read the config files from the user. For example,
this *will not* cause vim to open FILE with the user vim plugins,
configs, colorschemes, etc.

#+begin_src bash
$ sudo vim FILE
#+end_src

But we can use the ~--preserve-env~ option (~-E~) for short.

#+begin_src bash
$ sudo -E vim FILE
#+end_src

This should preserve current shell environment so the editor
configuration is respected when running with ~sudo~.

It is also possible to use ~sudoedit~ (also part of the ~sudo~ package and
man page, at least on Arch Linux), which will use the editor defined
with one of the env vars ~VISUAL~, ~EDITOR~, or ~SUDO_EDITOR~.
