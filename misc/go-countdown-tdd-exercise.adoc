== Intro

Write a countdown program that runs on the command line and prints a countdown from  3 to 1 and ends with "Go!", waiting N seconds in-between each printing.

.Sample countdown session on the terminal
[source,text]
----
$ go run main.go
3
(sleep 1 second)
2
(sleep another second)
1
(sleep yet another second)
Go!
----

Make sure your tests prove that you print and sleep in the correct sequence.

Also make sure to allow the countdown program to take some sort of config so users can configure how long to sleep after each print.

There should be no sleep after printing "Go!".
