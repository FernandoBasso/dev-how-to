It is nowhere to be found that, if not using DrRacket and selecting the student languages from the GUI, you can also do:

Beginning Student Language:

```
#lang htpd/bsl
#lang htdp/bsl+
```



Intermediate Student Language:

```
#lang htdp/isl
#lang htdp/isl+
```



Advanced Student Language:

```
#lang htdp/asl
```



Looks like [this link](https://docs.racket-lang.org/htdp-langs/index.html) would match with this:

* `bsl`: beginning student language
* `bsl+`: beginning student language with list abbreviations
* `isl`: intermediate student language
* `isl‚Å∫`: intermediate student language with lambda
* `asl`: advanced student language
