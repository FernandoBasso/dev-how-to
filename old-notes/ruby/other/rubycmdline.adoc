First:

    ruby --help | less


Use this command while learning/developing to run your ruby scripts:

    ruby -w program.rb


And sometimes this one:

    ruby --debug program.rb


To help a study session you can do:

    alias R='ruby -w'

and then run programs using the alias:

    R program.rb
