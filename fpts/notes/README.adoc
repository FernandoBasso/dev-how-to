== Intro

These are some notes, concepts and examples on functional programming with TypeScript.

We'll try avoid relying on type inference most of the time and instead write explicit type annotations for documentation purpose and also to improve our practice with types in general.

There are many reasons to avoid relying on type inference as a default approach, but we'll leave that to be discussed elsewhere.

We'll occasionally show some examples with vanilla JavaScript when we are explaining a concept where types are not part of the main point.

== Setup and Running

Install node:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ nvm install $(cat ./.nvmrc)
----

Then, on any new shell session:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ nvm use
----

Then, for any example to run (type “yes” the first time):

[source,shell-session]
----
$ npm install
$ npx ts-node ./src/example.ts
----

`ts-node` type-checks the code and refuses to run it if there is type errors, so use the `--transpileOnly`, or `-T` to run the code anyway even it contains non type-checking code.

[source,typescript]
----
$ npx ts-node -T ./src/example_with_type_error.ts
----

== Commits

Commit changes in this directory with the type “fpts” and a “scope” if it makes sense. Examples:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ git commit -m 'type: Subject text'
$ git commit -m 'type(scope): Subject text'

$ git commit -m 'fpts: Add first function example'
$ git commit -m 'fpts(docs): Improve readme '
----

[NOTE]
====
Of course, write the body of the commit messages as well if it makes sense for that commit.
====

== AsciiDoc

On Firefox, install the extension link:https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asciidoctorjs-live-preview/[Asciidoctor.js Live Preview Extension^] then simply open `README.adoc` on Firefox.

Alternatively, install `asciidoctor` and a few other ruby gems and generate the HTML and PDF files:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ gem install asciidoctor asciidoctor-pdf pygments.rb
$ asciidoctor -a source-highlighter=pygments ./README.adoc
$ asciidoctor-pdf -a source-highlighter=pygments ./README.adoc
----

Then open `README.html` or `README.pdf`.

== Concepts

=== Total and partial functions

In good functional programming, functions should be *total*, not *partial*.
But what is a partial function?
It is a function that is not defined for all set of its possible inputs.

Consider this `isEven()` function:

[source,javascript]
----
function isEven(x) {
  if (x === 0) return true;
  if (x === 1) return false;
  if (x === 2) return true;
}

[0, 1, 2, 3, 4].forEach(n => log(isEven(n)));
//=> true
//=> false
//=> true
//=> undefined
//=> undefined
----

The way `isEven()` above was implemented, it only handles three inputs, even though there is an infinite number of integers in the set of integer numbers.

We say (this implementation) of `isEven()` _is not defined for all of its possible inputs_.
In this case, it is defined only for the inputs `0`, `1` and `2`, and returns the appropriate boolean accordingly
For the other possible inputs, the function does nothing (which in JavaScript it means it returns `undefined`).

[NOTE]
====
Some languages like Haskell and Scala are able to warn us about partial functions.
For example, let's see what link:https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/latest/docs/users_guide/ghci.html[GHCi^] tells us for the same `isEven` implementation in Haskell:

[source,haskell]
----
isEven :: Int -> Bool
isEven 0 = True
isEven 1 = False
isEven 2 = True
----

Then load that code in `ghci`:

[source,text]
----
$ ghci
GHCi, version 9.4.8: https://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help

λ> :load ./src/even.hs

  |

  | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...
----
====

Partial functions are hard or impossible to compose, difficult to reason about, and cause unexpected and/or incorrect behavior on the applications that use them.

=== Deterministic functions

TODO

=== Immutable data structures

Immutable data: create new values from old ones.

TODO

=== Referential Transparency

TODO

=== Types

Think of types as sets.

If we create a type like this:

[source,typescript]
----
type Privilege = "Viewer" | "Editor" | "Admin";
----

Then the only values that can be assigned to a variable of type `Privilege` are "Viewer", "Editor" and "Admin".
So we can think of the type `Privilege` as a _set_, and only those three very specific strings can be members of that set.
No other string will be allowed:

[source,typescript]
----
const p: Privilege = "Commenter";
//    ~
// ~ Type '"Commenter"' is not assignable to type 'Privilege'.
----

A type like `number` can be thought of as a the infinite set of numbers.
Similarly, the type `string` means that all possible strings on the infinite set of all strings can be assigned to a variable of type `string`.

And, *very importantly, operations can be applied to values depending on the type of those values*.
A value of type `string` or `Array` can be _split_, because strings and arrays provide the _split_ operation.
A type `number` does not, so we cannot _split_ a number in the same sense we can split a string or an array.

So in short, a type is like a set of all possible values that can inhabit that type, and it also tells us which operations can be performed on those values.

=== Type cardinality

The cardinality of a type tells us the number of possible members that can inhabit that type (_set_).
In other words, the number of values that can be assigned to that type.

In the example above, the type `Privilege` has cardinality 3.
A type like `boolean` has cardinality 2, as there exists only two boolean values.

The cardinality of type `T` is represented a `|T|`.

If a function `isEven()` returns a boolean and it is a _total_ function, then the return type has cardinality 2, because the function is guaranteed to return either `true` or `false` and nothing else (because the function is _total_), and we would write the cardinality of the _total_ function `isEven` as `|boolean|`.

However, if that function is _partial_, then its return type has cardinality of 2 + 1, which means `true`, `false` and some other return “value” (like `null` or `undefined`) when the function is given an input it does not handle.
Therefore, we would write the cardinality of the _partial_ function `isEven` as `|boolean| + 1`.

== Compose

Compose a function that increments a number then turns it into a string.

[source,typescript]
----
function inc(x: number): number {
  return x + 1;
}

function toStr(x: number): string {
  return x.toString();
}

function incThenToStr(x: number) {
  return toStr(inc(x));
}
----

But the function composition is hard-coded.
It will always apply those two specific functions.
It is not _that_ helpful or reusable.
Ideally, we want a generic `compose` function.

== Compose v2

A very simple implementation where we hard-code the types `number` and `string`.
This is an initial implementation in which always exactly two functions can be composed.

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * Applies the functions right-to left, that is, first `g`, then `f`.
 */
function compose(
  f: (x: number) => string,
  g: (x: number) => number,
): (x: number) => string {
  return function composed(x: number): string {
    return f(g(x));
  };
}

/**
 * Increments `x` then returns it as a string.
 */
const incThenStr: (x: number) => string = compose(toStr, inc);

const res1: string = incThenStr(0);
log(res1, typeof res1);
//=> 1    string
----

It is still not very generic, but now at least `f` and `g` can be _any_ function at least match the expected type contracts.
For example:

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * Doubles `x` then returns it as a string.
 */
const doubleThenStr: (x: number) => string = compose(toStr, double);

const res2: string = doubleThenStr(7);
log(res2, typeof res2 });
//=> 14   string
----

== Compose with improved types

Notice our `g()` takes some type `T`, and returns some type `U` (`T` and `U` can be the same type, but they _don't have to_).
Then, `f` takes that type `U` and returns some type `R`.
What matters is that the return type of `g()` matches the input type of `f()` so that that the output of one function can be fed as the input of the other function.

With that in mind, we can refactor `compose()` to take generic types instead of the hard-coded `string` and `number`:

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * Applies the functions right-to left, that is, first `g`, then `f`.
 */
function compose<T, U, R>(
  f: (x: U) => R,
  g: (x: T) => U,
): (x: T) => R {
  return function composed(x: T): R {
    return f(g(x));
  };
}
----

And our examples from earlier still work just the same.
Neat!

== Currying

In functional programming, functions receive _one_ input and produce _one_ return value (even if it is a collection being returned, we consider it to be _one_ thing).
Functions that take one argument are the so called _unary_ functions, and their _arity_ is _one_.

Considering _referential transparency_, one could say that functions are aliases for their body definitions.

This next `add` function is _not_ unary.
It takes two input parameters:

[source,typescript]
----
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

log(add(1, 2));
//=> 3
----

Note to use this function we pass both parameters at once.
This is the normal, standard way in almost all non functional programming languages, or languages that don't support currying.
The above `add()` function takes two parameters.

But then, contrast with this:

[source,typescript]
----
function add(x: number): (y: number) => number {
  return function addY(y: number): number {
    return x + y;
  };
}

const res: number = add(1)(2);
//                  ---------
//                       \
//                        \
//                         v
//           Note the way we call add() now!
////

log(res);
//=> 3
----

Note that with this approach we first take an `x`, and return a function that takes an `y`, and finally compute and return the result.
This approach is possible thanks to ECMAScript _closures_.

Each function now takes a single parameter at a time, and returns another function that returns the next parameter.

We could call this “_manual currying_”, as we need to use the syntax `fn(a)(b)` which forces us to call functions in the `()()` fashion.

[NOTE]
====
We'll study a more interesting and currying implementation later which will make curried functions more practical to use.
====

But we already have some ways to make more specialized functions from our generic, curried `add()` function.
For example, in Haskell, we have `succ` and `pred`:

[source,text]
----
$ ghci

λ> succ 10
11

λ> pred 10
9
----

We can use `add()` to create similar implementations of `succ` and `pred` in ECMAScript:

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * Like Haskell succ and pred functions!
 */
const succ: (n: number) => number = add(1);
const pred: (n: number) => number = add(-1);

log(succ(10));
//=> 11

log(pred(10));
//=> 9
----

We call `add()` with one parameter, which causes it to return another function that is waiting for the final argument.

We call this _partial application_.
We define a _curried function_, and then we can _partially apply_ it to only some of its arguments, causing it to return yet another function.
When all the expected arguments have been provided by successively calling each function in turn with its expected argument (remember our functions are _unary_ when talking about curring), then it returns the final result!

== curry2 utility

Instead of creating `add()` with manual currying, let's create a `curry2()` function that takes a function of arity 2 (two arguments), and returns a curried version of that function.

Initially, let's consider a non-generic typed function that takes and returns numbers:

[source,typescript]
----
//
// A type alias just for fun.
//
type Num = number;

/**
 * A utility that knows how to curry a function of arity 2.
 */
function curry2(f: (x: Num, y: Num) => Num) {
  return function withArg1(a: Num): (b: Num) => Num {
    return function withArg2(b: Num): Num {
      return f(a, b);
    };
  };
}

const add2 = curry2(add);

//
// Call add2 with one param, which returns a function that takes
// the other param, which in turn returns the final result.
//
log(add2(1)(2));
//=> 3
----

The above typing is too specific and only works for numbers.
Let's use generic and make it take any types:

[source,typescript]
----
/**
 * A utility that knows how to curry a function of arity 2.
 */
function curry2<T, U, R>(f: (x: T, y: U) => R) {
  return function withArg1(a: T): (b: U) => R {
    return function withArg2(b: U): R {
      return f(a, b);
    };
  };
}

/**
 * A standard add function of arity 2 that adds two numbers.
 */
function add(x: number, y: number): number {
  return x + y;
}

/**
 * A standard function concat of arity 2 that concatenates two strings.
 */
function concat(s1: string, s2: string): string {
  return `${s1}${s2}`;
}

const add2 = curry2(add);
const concat2 = curry2(concat);

log(add2(1)(2));
//=> 3

log(concat2("ECMA")("Script"));
//=> ECMAScript
----

In the examples, we are able to curry functions of arity two of numbers and strings, but it would work with any other type.

For the sake of exemplifying a different implementation (which yields the same result), we could define the type separately and then use it to implement `curry2()` with an arrow function:

[source,typescript]
----
type Curry2 = <T, U, R>(f: (t: T, u: U) => R)
  => (t: T)
  => (u: U)
  => R;

const curry2: Curry2 = f => x => y => f(x, y);
----

[NOTE]
====
Arrow functions are neither better nor were they created to deprecate or replace standard function statements or function expressions created with the `function` keyword.
They were created to address specific use cases, that's all.
====

== Recursion

=== Approach 1

An example `sum()` function implemented with recursion:

[source,typescript]
----
function sum(xs: number[]): number {
  if (xs.length === 0) return 0;
  return xs[0] + sum(xs.slice(1));
}

log(sum([]));
//=> 0

log(sum([-1, -2, -3]));
//=> -6
----

=== Approach 2 with destructuring

A more idiomatic way of implementing it could be with destructuring the first element and the rest first before recursing:

[source,typescript]
----
function sum(xs: number[]): number {
  if (xs.length === 0) return 0;
  const [head, ...rest] = xs;
  return head + sum(rest);
}

log(sum([]));
//=> 0

log(sum([-1, -2, -3]));
//=> -6
----

=== Approach 3 with go pattern and tail call syntax

Or using the _go pattern_, which is a nested function that then handles an accumulator.
This approach would conform to the _tail call_ recursion idea.
*Except* ECMAScript (at least as of 2024) does not support tail call optimization so even though the syntax of the next example _looks_ like tail call, it doesn't actually result in any performance benefits and the call stack keeps growing as if no tail call style had been used.

[source,typescript]
----
function sum(nums: number[]): number {
  return (function go(acc: number, xs: number[]): number {
    if (xs.length === 0) return acc;
    const [x, ...restOfXs] = xs;
    return go(acc + x, restOfXs);
    //        <1>
  })(0, nums);
}

log(sum([]));
//=> 0

log(sum([-1, -2, -3]));
//=> -6
----

<1> Here, `acc + x` means we are immediately computing the next value of the accumulator, without enqueueing that computation and and next recursion call as a new frame (but as mentioned, it doesn't do any good in ECMAScript any way).

[NOTE]
====
Tail call happens when the recursion call is the last thing executed in the body of the function, which allows language compilers to optimize and return the new computed value immediately for the next recursive call instead of keeping adding frames to the call stack until the base case is reached.

Without tail call, frames keep being added to the stack, and there is an _unwinding_ phase where the final computation of the values is performed.
With tail call, no frames are added to the stack (so no stack overflows) and there is no need for the _unwinding_ phase.
====

The `sum()` function returns 0 (zero) for the empty array input because 0 (zero) is the identify for addition and subtraction (1 is the identity for multiplication and division).
Adding or subtracting 0 from a stem:[x] produces stem:[x], the same as multiplying or dividing stem:[x] also produces stem:[x].

== Divide and Increment Composition Example

Let's consider a scenario where we have a price and its payment will be divided between a certain amount of people.
We know the price beforehand, but not how many people will share its payment (not everyone will show up for the pizza party).

First, study this code carefully:

[source,typescript]
----
import { curry2 } from "./lib";

const div = curry2(
  function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): number {
    return dividend / divisor;
  }
);

//
// We know the price.
//
const price: number = 42

//
// And the price is to be paid by a few people, but we yet don't know
// how many people will help paying it. Partially apply the more generic
// `div` function to the `price`, and store the returned function in a
// more specific-named identifier.
//
const divPriceBy: (x: number) => number = div(price);

//
// Divide the price between two people.
//
log(divPriceBy(2));
//=> 21

//
// Divide the price between six people.
//
log(divPriceBy(6));
//=> 7

//
// Divide the price between zero people.
//
log(divPriceBy(0));
//=> Infinity
// Oops! This is not good. No division by zero should occur.
////
----

First thing to note is that we can create a more specific `divPriceBy` function from the more generic `div`.

Second thing to note is that it might be possible that due some unfortunate reason, division by zero could be attempted.

But then suppose each person dividing the the price will also give a 1-dollar tip to the person delivering the pizza.
That means we would get the result of `divPriceBy` and increment by 1.
So we complement our code with one more function, and compose `inc` and `divPriceBy`:

[source,typescript]
----
import { curry2, compose2 } from "./lib";

function inc(x: number): number {
  return x + 1;
}

const div = curry2(
  function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): number {
    return dividend / divisor;
  }
);

const price: number = 42

const divPriceBy: (x: number) => number = div(price);

const calcPriceWithTip = compose2(inc, divPriceBy);

log(calcPriceWithTip(6));
//=> 8
//
// 42 / 6 = 7, + 1 for tip is 8. This is correct ✅.
////

//
// But if we divide by zero, it returns Infinity, and incrementing
// Infinity by 1 is still Infinity. This is simply wrong ❌.
//
log(calcPriceWithTip(0));
//=> Infinity
----

== Do or do not, there is no try

image::yoda-no-try.png[Yoda, do or do not, there is no try]

In functional programming, try/catch approach is neither idiomatic nor the preferred way to handle adverse conditions .
Instead, a value (or absence of it) is returned the signals some sort of erroneous condition and the caller handles it as appropriate.

To get started with handling division by zero (which could extend to other erroneous conditions we'd want to signal) let's update `div` to return `null`.

[source,typescript]
----
const div = curry2(
  function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): number | null {
    if (divisor === 0) return null;
    return dividend / divisor;
  }
);
----

But then we get type problems with the composition.
As `inc` _requires_ a `number`, but `div` can now potentially return `null`, we can't compose `inc` and `div` any longer.

[source,typescript]
----
const calcPriceWithTip = compose2(inc, divPriceBy);
//                                     ~~~~~~~~~~
//                                         /
//                                        /
//                                       /
//                                      v
// Argument of type '(x: number) => number | null' is not assignable
// to parameter of type '(v: number) => number'.
//   Type 'number | null' is not assignable to type 'number'.
//     Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'number'.
////
----

But now, in the case of `divPriceBy(0)`, which returns `null`, the `null` result is piped into `inc`, and it becomes `null + 1`, which in this case first converts `null` to 0 (zero), then adds 1 to it, making the result 1.
We get 1, which seems OK but, but it is wrong.
We are returning `null` to signal some sort of problem, which should be handled in some way, but instead we get a meaningless number back for the given input of 0.

If we update `div` to return `undefined` when the input is 0, then `divPriceBy(0)` returns `undefined`, which when fed into `inc` produces `NaN`, as `undefined + 1` results in `NaN`.
At least we don't get a normal number, but we are still not properly signaling adversity with our code.
But worry not.
We are getting there.

== Signaling Absence of a Value

In functional programming, there is a type called `Option` which can be used for situations where it is known a function may fail to produce a useful result.
The function returns an `Option` type constructor, which produces `Some` and `None` data types, `Some` meaning we got some value, and `None` meaning the function produced no useful value result.

[NOTE]
====
Some languages use an alternative name `Maybe` type constructor, which produces the `Just` and `Nothing` data types.
====

Let's start working out our `Option` type constructor.

[source,typescript]
----
type Option<T> = T | null;
type MaybeNum = Option<number>;
type MaybeStr = Option<string>;
----

What are the types of `MaybeNum` and `MaybeStr`?
The types are `number | null` and `string | null` respectively.

We could update our `div` to return an `Option<number>`:

[source,typescript]
----
type MaybeNum = Option<number>;

const div = curry2(
  function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): Option<number> {
    if (divisor === 0) return null;
    return dividend / divisor;
  }
);

const divPriceBy: (x: number) => Option<number> = div(6);
----

The return type reads a little more FPish, but we are still just returning `null` if the divisor is 0, and will have the same problems as before if we `compose2(inc, divPriceBy)` to calculate the price for each person plus the 1-dollar tip.

== Data Constructors Some and None v1

One way we could define the data constructors `Some` and `None`, and functions to produce such values:

[source,typescript]
----
const none = Symbol('None');
type None = typeof none;

function some<T>(val: T): { val: T } {
  return { val };
}

type Some<V> = { val: V };

type Option<T> = Some<T> | None;

function inc(x: number): number {
  return x + 1;
}

function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): Option<number> {
  if (divisor === 0) return none;
  return some(dividend / divisor);
}

log(div(8, 2));
//=> { val: 4 }

log(div(8, 0));
//=> Symbol(None)
----

Note `div` returns `none` or `some(value)`.
Also observe that `some()` is a function that knows how to produce a `Some<T>` value.
How to handle the returned value will be covered later on.

[NOTE]
====
Using `none` and `some()` in lowercase for the values doesn't look very natural and FPish for people used to some other FP languages.

Let's leave it like that for now and keep improving our understanding and code little by little.
====

== Data Constructors Some and None v2

We can also use _branded types_ to define our data and value constructors.

[source,typescript]
----
type None = {
  readonly __tag: 'None';
};

const none: Option<never> = {
  __tag: 'None',
};

type Some<V> = {
  readonly __tag: 'Some';
  readonly val: V;
};

function some<V>(v: V): Option<V> {
  return {
    __tag: 'Some',
    val: v,
  };
}

type Option<T> = Some<T> | None;

function inc(x: number): number {
  return x + 1;
}

function div(dividend: number, divisor: number): Option<number> {
  if (divisor === 0) return none;
  return some(dividend / divisor);
}

log(div(8, 2));
//=> { __tag: 'Some', val: 4 }

log(div(8, 0));
//=> { __tag: 'None' }
----

Because of TypeScript's structural type, our lowercase `none` and `some()` match the uppercase types `None` `Some`.

The function `div()` has a return type of `Option<number>`, which ends up being the union type `Some<T> | None`, and our `some()` and `none` produce values whose types structurally match that return type, so the type checker is happy with the implementation body of `div()` which conditionally returns one or the other type of value.

[NOTE]
====
Remember that TypeScript features a _structural type system_ (not a nominal type system like most mainstream languages).
====

== Signaling Erroneous Conditions

`Option` (or `Maybe`) is used to signal that a value might be absent.
There is also the `Either` is similar, but used to provide useful information on _why_ a useful value was absent.
