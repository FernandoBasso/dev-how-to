== Completion

=== Autocomplete

The one that shows the completion “bellow”:

[source,text]
----
$ brew install zsh-autocomplete
Installation
1. Add at or near the top of your .zshrc file (before any calls to compdef):
  source /opt/homebrew/share/zsh-autocomplete/zsh-autocomplete.plugin.zsh
2. Remove any calls to compinit from your .zshrc file.
3. If you're using Ubuntu, add to your .zshenv file:
  skip_global_compinit=1
Then restart your shell.
