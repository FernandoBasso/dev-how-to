= until

Print numbers from 4 to 1:

    num = 4
    until num == 0
      print num
      num -= 1
    end
    # →  4321

Using until as a modifier. Version 1:

    num = 5
    print num -= 1 until num == 1
    # →  4321

Using until as a modifier. Version 2:

    num = 5
    print num until (num -=1) == 0


It seems the assignment happens first, then the printing is done.
