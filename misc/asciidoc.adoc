== Introduction

AsciiDoc is the best non-html-like markup language.
It is simpler as Markdown for the simple things, while also offering way more useful, powerful and advanced features if when they are needed.

== Convert Markdown to AsciiDoc

To convert from Markdown to AsciiDoc, use kramdown.
It is better suited than pandoc as it has more AsciiDoc-sensible options.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ gem install kramdown kramdown-asciidoc

$ for file in ./*.md ; do
    kramdoc \
      --format=GFM \
      --output="${file%.md}.adoc" \
      --wrap=ventilate "$file"
  done

$ rm -vi ./*.md

== Convert AsciiDoc to Markdown

* https://github.com/opendevise/downdoc

In short:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ npx downdoc -o ./intro.md ./intro.adoc
----

== Source Highlighter

Add this attribute to the document:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: <which highlighter to use>
----

As of 2023, the docs currently say for pygments we simply write `pygments`.

image::asciidoctor-source-highlighter-pygments.rb-2023-11-11T14-33-05-612Z.png[Asciidoctor Source Highlighter pygments.rb]

but I got an error with this:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: pygments
----

[source,shell-session]
----
$ asciidoctor ./algds/other/prime_factors/README.adoc
asciidoctor: WARNING: optional gem 'pygments.rb' is not available (reason: cannot load 'pygments'). Functionality disabled.
----

But if I changing to `pygments.rb` works:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: pygments.rb

=== Source Highlighter Not Working

We have observed at times that if `asciidoctor` is installed from a `Gemfile` and `pygments.rb` is installed with `gem install`, it may fail (with no errors) to add the tags around the code tokens.

Installing everything from `Gemfile` and then running `bundle exec asciidoctor file.adoc` worked.


One can preview AsciiDoc rendered document in many ways, including editors, browser extensions, or on Gitlab, Github, and probably other services as well.

== Writing Best Practices

Do follow the link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[one sentence per line^] approach.

=== adoc-mode image preview not working

I had a problem where the image preview was not working.

The reason was the characters ++&#44;++ inside the alt description of the image that causing some parsing issue or something.
Removing some of those symbols caused the image preview to start working as expected.

I ended up turning this:

[source,text]
----
image:__assets/reserved-words.png[OpenGroup POSIX Spec&#44; on Reserved Words]
----

To this:

[source,text]
----
image:__assets/reserved-words.png[OpenGroup POSIX Spec on Reserved Words].
----

Then the image preview worked as expected.

=== Ventilated Prose (aka “one sentence per line”)

Don’t wrap text at a fixed column width.
Instead, put each sentence on its own line, a technique called
sentence per line.
This technique is similar to how you write and organize source code.
The result can be spectacular.

Here are some of the advantages of using the sentence per line style:

* It prevents reflows (meaning a change early in the paragraph won’t cause the remaining lines in the paragraph to reposition).
* You can easily swap sentences.
* You can easily separate or join paragraphs.
* You can comment out sentences or add commentary to them.
* You can spot sentences which are too long or sentences that vary widely in length.
* You can spot redundant (and thus mundane) patterns in your writing.

We picked up this idea from the writing guide in the Neo4j documentation.
However, it seems like the idea dates back a discovery by Buckminster Fuller in the 1930s, who called it link:https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/ventilated-prose/[ventilated prose].
 The technique was also recommended in 2009 by Brandon Rhodes in a blog post about link:https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/[semantic linefeeds^].

It’s important to note that this technique works because AsciiDoc doesn’t treat wrapped lines in prose as hard line breaks.
 At least, it doesn’t show up that way to the reader.
 The line breaks between contiguous lines of prose will not be visible in the rendered document (i.e., as the reader sees it).
While a single line break doesn’t appear in the output, two consecutive line breaks starts a new paragraph (or other block).
