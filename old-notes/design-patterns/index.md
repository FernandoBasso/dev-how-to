# Design Patterns

This section contains concepts, notes and examples with diagrams and code about design patterns.

We mostly show text, diagrams and the main pieces of code in the pages, and [unit tests can be found in the source code directory](https://gitlab.com/devhowto/Dev-How-To/-/tree/main/src/design-patterns) for each example.
