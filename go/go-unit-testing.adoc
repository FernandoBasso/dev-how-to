== Introduction to unit testing in Go

Go ships with the 'testing' package.
Example:

.hello_test.go
[source,go]
----
package hello

import "testing"

func TestHelloWorld(t *testing.T) {
	expected := "Hello, World!"
	if observed := HelloWorld(); observed != expected {
		t.Fatalf("HelloWorld() = %v, want %v", observed, expected)
	}
}
----

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to end your file name with `_test.go`.
Read `go help test` for details.
====

Then run with:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test
----

Or test a specific package:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test hello
----

Or using the `-v` flag to also the list of tests descriptors:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test -v
$ go test -v hello
----

Or to run tests that match a specific description, use `-run <description>`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test -v -cover -run 'Triangle'
----

=== Test single _test.go file

Go needs to compile `.go` files that are need for a given test file.
For example, if we try to test `builder_test.go`, depending on how we run the test command, `go` fails to find the pieces of implementation used in the tests.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test -v ./libhouse/builder_test.go
# command-line-arguments [command-line-arguments.test]
libhouse/builder_test.go:10:14: undefined: getBuilder
libhouse/builder_test.go:18:20: undefined: House
FAIL	command-line-arguments [build failed]
FAIL
----

But we can run tests in the entire `libhouse` package (as other necessary `.go` files will also be processed) and filter specific tests we want with `-run TestName` instead:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ go test -v ./libhouse -run TestBuilder
=== RUN   TestBuilder
=== RUN   TestBuilder/returns_a_normal_builder
--- PASS: TestBuilder (0.00s)
    --- PASS: TestBuilder/returns_a_normal_builder (0.00s)
PASS
ok  	main/libhouse	0.002s
----

A similar thing happens with `go run`.
We may get those ‘undefined’ error messages unless we run a command in such a way that `go run` is able to process all the necessary files.

== Subtests (or subcases) leaking state?

Consider testing a counter singleton with a test file like this one:

[source,go]
----
package singleton

import "testing"

func TestGetInstance(t *testing.T) {
	t.Run("create instance correctly", func(t *testing.T) {
		counter := GetInstance()

		if counter == nil {
			t.Error("Expected Singleton instance, got nil")
		}
	})

	t.Run("always returns he same reference", func(t *testing.T) {
		ref1 := GetInstance()
		ref2 := GetInstance()

		if ref1 != ref2 {
			t.Error("Counters are not the same reference to the same instance")
		}
	})

	t.Run("returns correct value on first call", func(t *testing.T) {
		count := GetInstance().AddOne()

		if count != 1 {
			t.Errorf("Want 1 for first call, got %d", count)
		}
	})

	t.Run("returns correct value on each subsequent call", func(t *testing.T) {
		counter := GetInstance()

		_ = counter.AddOne()
		valueForCall2 := counter.AddOne()

		if valueForCall2 != 2 {
			t.Errorf("Want 2 for second call, got %d", valueForCall2)
		}
	})
}
----

Basically, `GetInstance()` returns an instance of a counter singleton, and each time `AddOne()` is invoked on that instance, it increments and returns the next value of the counter.

But the last subtest fails because the value of the counter is 3, not 2!

And the problem is that the previous subtest invokes `AddOne()` once, and value of counter in the next subtest already starts at 1 (not 0).

This is not a problem with the singleton itself, which is supposed to be shared anyway (“Hey, that is what a singleton should do, right?”), but they way tests and subtests work in Go.
The tests and subtests *do not* run like if they were individual programs (like in some other testing libraries in other languages).
In the tests above, `counter`, `ref1` and `ref2` are all the same reference even though they are on their own blocks.
So the `counter` we assigned in the first subtest creates an instance in memory which is shared with the other subtests.

Initially, we could think each test and each subtest should behave like its own, individual program, with its own memory allocation.
But that is not the case.
In reality, all tests of a single package behave like a single, individual program.
And that is so true we can even define a `TestMain` for every individual package.
