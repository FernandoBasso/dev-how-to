#+TITLE: Org File 1
#+STARTUP: content
#+PROPERTY: header-args :exports example

* Intro

An example org file to test and try stuff.

Some =/foo/gi= verbatim. 2Â² and 2_2 \theta \pi{}d

* Examples

** TypeScript

#+begin_src typescript
interface MyObj {
    [name: number]: number;
}
#+end_src


This is a fine verse:

#+begin_verse
Great clouds overhead
Tiny black birds rise and fall
Snow covers Emacs

---AlexSchroeder
#+end_verse

And this, a most fine quote from Albert Einstein:

#+begin_quote
Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not any simpler.

---Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

And some centered text:

#+begin_center
It is better to remain silent at the risk of being thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt of it.
#+end_center


* Exporting

If we use inline code like...

: src_example{(+ x 1)}

...it does not get exported. Either use

: src_example[:exports example]{(+ x 1)}

or have something like this at the header of the org file:

: #+PROPERTY: header-args :exports code

which then allows you to omit the ~[:exports example]~ inline.

So let's see some inline scheme like src_example{(+ x 1)} exported. The code part gets exported to UTF-8 as

: `(+ x 1)'

~:exports example~ could be ~:exports verbatim~, ~:exports code~, or the other available types of export.

* Conclusion

This is the end.
