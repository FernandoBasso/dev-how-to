= Hints

== 1. Estimate the preparation time

* Use the https://pkg.go.dev/builtin#len[`len()` built-in function] to determine the number of layers (length of the layers slice).

== 2. Compute the amounts of noodles and sauce needed

* First, set up two variables to track the amount of noodles and sauce.
* Use a for loop to iterate through the layers.
* If you encounter a `'noodles'` or `'sauce'` layer in your loop, increase the amount stored in the respective variable accordingly.

== 3. Add the secret ingredient

* Revisit link:/tracks/go/concepts/slices[slices] to find out how to retrieve an element from an slice and how to replace an element in a slice.
* The index of the last element in a slice `a` is `len(a) - 1`.

== 4. Scale the recipe

* First make a new slice of the same size as the input slice
* Use a https://tour.golang.org/flowcontrol/1[for loop] to iterate through the input slice and generate the output slice
