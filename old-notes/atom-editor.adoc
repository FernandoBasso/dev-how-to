= Atom Tips

If you are behind a proxy and can't install stuff, try this:

[source,bash]
----
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0 \
    atom --proxy-server=http://192.168.1.254:7777
----

NOTE: The ip and port are just an example.

You may also try setting stuff on `~/.atom/.apmrc`:

----
strict-ssl=false
http_proxy=http://192.168.1.254:7777
https_proxy=http://192.168.1.254:777
----
