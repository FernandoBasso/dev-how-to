== Random Notes

Sometimes, it is useful to group tests around a “thing” and then have subtests describing different scenarios.
Each scenario can also be thought of as a use case.

It is important that your tests are clear specifications of what the code needs to do.

When tests are passing, we can and should refactor the tests themselves if we can think of any improvements, including the test descriptions.
