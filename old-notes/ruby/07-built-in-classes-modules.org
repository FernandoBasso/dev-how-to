* Lteral Constructors

Scalar Objects are one value. Scalars don't contain other objects. Examples of scalars are strings, numbers and symbols.

Strings contain chars, but there is no char type on Ruby. One char in Ruby is actually a String of one char.

Collections are objects that contain other objects.

Most of Ruby built-in classes can be instantiated using `new'. Just a few can't.



~+~ is a method, but it is sugared so we can use like if it were an operator.

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
p 1 + 2 == 1.+(2)
#+END_SRC



Study by topic I research about. Topics could be things like
- operators
- command line
- classes and objects
- creating gems
- blocks vs procs vs lambdas
- regex
- strings
- math
etc
