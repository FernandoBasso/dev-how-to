== Accessing Elements

In Ruby, array elements can be accessed in a few different ways. Given the following array:

[source,ruby]
----
xs = %w{ may the force be with you }
----


.By index
[source,ruby]
----
p xs[0]
# → "may"

p xs[-1] # last
# → "you"
----

.By a range
[source,ruby]
----
p xs[0..2] # Indexes 0, 1 and 2.
# → ["may", "the", "force"]

# Starting and pos, get len elements.
pos = 1
len = 4
p xs[pos...(pos + len)]
# → ["the", "force", "be", "with"]
----

.A method
[source,ruby]
----
p xs.at(2)
# → "force"
----

== Adding Elements

NOTE: The following methods return the array with the element(s) added. They are destructive methods; they modify the array in-place instead of returning a copy of it with the new element(s) added.

[source,ruby]
----
xs = []

# Add one or more elements to the end.
xs.push('with', 'you')
# → ["with", "you"]

# Add one or more elements to the beginning.
xs.unshift('may')
# → ["may", "with", "you"]

# Inserts one or more elements before the specified index.
xs.insert(1, 'the', 'force', 'be')
# → ["may", "the", "force", "be", "with", "you"]
----

== Removing Elements

Examples on `pop`, `shift` and `delete_at` and `delete`.

Contrary to `push`, `unshift`, `insert`, which return the array with the new element(s) added, these _deletion_ methods return the element being removed. Still, they are also destructive, meaning, the modify the array in-place.

NOTE: These methods mutate the array in-place.

[source,ruby]
----
xs = %w{ may the the force be the with you }
# → ["may", "the", "the", "force", "be", "the", "with", "you"]

# Remove last element.
xs.pop
# → "you"
p xs
# → ["may", "the", "the", "force", "be", "the", "with"]

xs.shift
# → "may"
p xs
# → ["the", "the", "force", "be", "the", "with"]

xs.delete_at(3)
# → "be"
p xs
# → ["the", "the", "force", "the", "with"]

xs.delete('the')
# → "the"
p xs
# → ["force", "with"]
