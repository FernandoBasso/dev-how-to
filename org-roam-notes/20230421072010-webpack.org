* Config

When ~webpack.config.js~ returns an array of config objects (rather than a
single config object), it can run each of those at once, like if there
is a mobile and desktop config, or client and server configs, then
those can run at the same time and not one after the other.

#+begin_example
const client = { ... };
const server = { ... };
const modFedLib = { ... };

module.exports = [
  client,
  server,
  modfedlib,
];
#+end_example
