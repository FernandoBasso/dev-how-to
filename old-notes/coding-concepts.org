Self-documenting code expresses what it does clealy. ~2 + 2~ is self explanatory and doesn't need comments to explain it. Still, sometimes it is nice to have comments that explain /why/ the code is doing what it is doing. Example:

#+BEGIN_SRC ruby
@checkout.credit_card_form.card_number.fill_in('123456789')

# Clicks on the other field so it triggers the ~blur~ event on the
# previous one, which sends an ajax to validade the card number, which
# triggers a 'loading' animation that blocks the entire page.
@checkout.credit_card_form.card_password.click
@checkout.wait_for_ajax

# Now the 'loading' animation should be finished and the form is
# accessible again for the next step.
@checkout.credit_card_form.card_password.fill_in('s3cr37')
#+END_SRC
