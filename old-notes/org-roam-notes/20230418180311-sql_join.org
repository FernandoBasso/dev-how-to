#+title: SQL-JOIN

* Join Products and Images

** Select only products with images

Select all products and images for all products that have images. For
this, we use ~INNER JOIN~.

#+begin_src sql
SELECT
    P.id
  , P.name
  , I.id
FROM products AS P
INNER JOIN images AS I
ON P.id = I.product_id;
#+end_src

** Select products with or without images

If a product has an image, select it. If it does not, still select the
product even though the image will be missing:

#+begin_src sql
SELECT
    P.id
  , P.name
  , I.id
FROM products AS P
LEFT JOIN images AS I
ON P.id = I.product_id;
#+end_src

Note we used ~LEFT JOIN~ this time.
