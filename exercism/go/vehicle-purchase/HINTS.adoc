= Hints

== 1. Determine if you will need a driver's license

* Use the https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators[equals comparison operator] to check whether your input equals a certain string.
* Use one of the two https://golang.org/ref/spec#Logical_operators[logical operators] you learned about in the boolean concept to combine the two requirements.
* You do *not* need an if-statement to solve this task.
You can return the boolean expression you build directly.

== 2. Choose between two potential vehicles to buy

* Use a https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators[comparison operator] to determine which option comes first in lexicographical order.
* Then set the value of a helper variable depending of the outcome of that comparison with the help of an an https://golang.org/ref/spec#If_statements[if-else statement].
* Finally construct the recommendation sentence.
For that you can use the `+` operator to concatenate the two strings.

== 3. Calculate an estimation for the price of a used vehicle

* Start with determining the percentage of the original price based on the age of the vehicle.
Save it in a helper variable.
Use an https://golang.org/ref/spec#If_statements[if-else if-else statement] as mentioned in the instructions.
* In the two if conditions use https://golang.org/ref/spec#Comparison_operators[comparison operators] to compare the age of the car to the threshold values.
* To calculate the result, apply the percentage to the original price.
For example `30% of x` can be calculated by dividing `30` by `100` and multiplying with `x`.
