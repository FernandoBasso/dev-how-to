# Memoize

- [Memoize on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/memoize/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=30-days-of-javascript).

Memoization basically means caching previously computed values so that it doesn't have to be recomputed again for the same inputs, thus making things more performant.

Of course, it will use more memory (as we are storing previously computed values).
So memoization improves the time complexity, even though it hurts space complexity.

Memoization is used a lot in dynamic programming situations.

Memoization is also a decorator of sorts, as it will *enhance* some existing function to add caching for performance reasons.
