=== Peano Axioms about Natural Numbers:

1. 0 is a natural number.

Equality Axioms:

[start=2]
2. For every number `x`, `x = x` (reflexive).
3. For all numbers `x` and `y`, if `x = y`, then `y = x` (symmetric).
4. For all numbers `x`, `y` and `z`, if `x = y` and `y = z`, then `x = z` (transitive).
5. For all `a` and `b`, if `b` is a natural number and `a = b`, then `a` is also a natural number (closed under equality).

Axioms about the Successor function:

[start=6]
6. For every number `n`, `S(n)` is a number (closed under successor).
7. For all numbers `m` and `n`, `m = n` if, and only if `S(m) = S(n)` (`S` is an injection).
8. For every number `n`, `S(n) = 0` is false (0 is the starting point).

There is a 9th axion about induction, that says that “it is true for 0, and it is true for one, so it is true for everything.”
