== Intro

In this page I'll try to collect examples of instances where I have used sed to solve (or help to solve) actual stuff on my personal or work projects.
There will be no `s/this/that/` examples on this page ðŸ˜….

== Extract credentials from cloud provider script

We have a script that fetches and dumps some secrets and credentials that we need to inspect for one reason or another.

In this example, `get-credentials.sh` takes a parameter that indicates from which database instance/environment we want the credentials for (dev, stage, prod, etc.):

[source,text]
----
$ ./get-credentials.sh stage-db
Secret {
  "ARN": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:me-central-1:1234:secret:my-credentials-zZ247W",
  "Name": "my-credentials",
  "VersionId": "some-uuid",
  "SecretString": "{\"username\":\"yoda\",\"password\":\"h4ck3r\",\"reader\":\"reader.url.example.dev\",\"writer\":\"writer.url.example.dev\"}",
  "VersionStages": [
    "FOO",
    "BAR",
  ],
  "CreatedDate": "2020-12-02T02:20:99.787000-03:00"
}
----

Observe the output includes stuff we don't really care about.
What we want is the content of `SecretString` nicely printed and formatted.
We cannot simply pipe that whole output to a command line tool like `jq` because it (the output) is not valid JSON.
Also note because the contents of "SecretString" has all those escaped quotes, a tool like `jq` will not parse it into multiple key-value pairs, but instead, due to the escapes, it is a single string.

What we can do to help a bit is to feed that output to a sed script.
Let's create a file, maybe called `parse.sed` and add this content inside:

[source,text]
----
##
# Keep only line that contains SecretString.
#
/SecretString/!d

##
# Drop leading spaces and trailing spaces.
#
s/(^ *| *$)//g

##
# Get only the actual secret-related data we are interested in.
#
s/"SecretString": (.*)/\1/

##
# Drop trailing comma.
#
s/,$//

##
# Drop the scapes from the \" escaped double quotes.
#
s/\\//g

##
# Drop first and last double quote.
#
s/(^"|"$)//g

#
# The output should now be a valid JSON that could be fed to jq for
# nice formatting and visualization.
#
----

Then, by combining our script that gets and prints the credentials to STDOUT with our Sed script to clean that output up, and then passing _that_ result to `jq`, we should have a nicely formatted output which is easier to understand for our specific purposes.

  "writer": "writer.url.example.dev"
