== Strings

=== Retrieving single characters.

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'Use the force!'
=> "Use the force!"

# Last char.
>> s[s.size - 1]
=> "!"

# Last char too!
>> s[-1]
=> "!"

# Last but one (penultimate).
>> s[-2]
=> "e"

# First.
>> s[0]
=> "U"
----

And unicode stuff words as expected (since ruby 1.9):

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'Poop ðŸ’©'
=> "Poop ðŸ’©"
>> s[-1] # <1>
=> "ðŸ’©"
----

1. Takes the last character, codepoint, not the last byte.


=== Retrieving Multiple Characters

[source,ruby]
----
# Starting at index 2, take 2 chars.
>> s[2, 2]
=> "op"

# Starting at index 2, take 3 chars.
>> s[2, 3]
=> "op "

# Starting at index 2, take 4 chars.
>> s[2, 4]
=> "op ðŸ’©"
----

=== Assigning to String Positions

Using the same approach as demonstrated above, we can also assign to one or more index position of a string.

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'Poop ðŸ’©'
=> "Poop ðŸ’©"
=> "ðŸ’©"

# Replace the first char with `L`.
>> s[0] = 'L'
=> "L"
>> s
=> "Loop ðŸ’©"
----

Or assign multiple characters (strings) at once:

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'lambda'
=> "lambda"
>> s[0] = 'L'
=> "L"
>> s
=> "Lambda"

# Append " Calculus" to the end.
>> s[s.size] = ' Calculus'
=> " Calculus"

# At position 6, replace 1 char (the space) with " Î» ".
>> s[6, 1] = ' Î» '
=> " Î» "
>> s
=> "Lambda Î» Calculus"
----


== Introduction to Ruby Encoding

Until ruby 1.8 strings were a collection of bytes. Not good for i18n/Intl stuff. Ruby 1.9 improved the situation.

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'Ruby â™¥'
=> "Ruby â™¥"
>> s.encoding
=> #<Encoding:UTF-8>
>> s.encoding.name
=> "UTF-8"
>> s.length
=> 6
>> s.size
=> 6
>> s.bytesize
=> 8
----

Also try `puts Encoding.list` and `p Encoding.list`.

== Change String Encoding

[source,irb]
----
>> s = 'Ruby â™¥'
=> "Ruby â™¥"

>> s.force_encoding(Encoding::ISO_8859_1)
=> "Ruby \xE2\x99\xA5"

>> s.force_encoding(Encoding::ISO_8859_1).encoding
=> #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>
----


== String Iteration

Up to Ruby 1.8, there was a single `each` method on strings. But would it iterate over each byte or each character? In Ruby 1.9, `each` was _removed_ from `String`, and more specific and delcarative choices were implemented instead.The method names speak for themselves.

- `each_byte`
- `each_char`
- `each_codepoint`
- `each_line`

For example, iterate over the chars, and count the bytes to ultimately count how many chars in the string are multibyte.

[source,ruby,lineos]
----
def count_multibyte_chars(s)
  count = 0

  s.each_char do |c|
    count += 1 if c.bytesize > 1
  end

  count
end

p count_multibyte_chars('Lambda Î» Rocks â™¥')
