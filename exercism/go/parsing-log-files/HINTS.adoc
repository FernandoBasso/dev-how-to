* API documentation: https://pkg.go.dev/regexp[package regexp]
* Regular expression syntax: https://pkg.go.dev/regexp/syntax[regexp/syntax]
* Website https://regex101.com/[regex101.com] has an online regular expression tester.
* It is recommended to write regular expressions as https://yourbasic.org/golang/regexp-cheat-sheet/#raw-strings[raw string literals] enclosed by backticks.

== 1. Identify garbled log lines

* Function [regexp.MatchString][fun-match-string] or method https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.MatchString[MatchString] could be useful here.
* In a regular expression, the character `^` matches the beginning of a line/string.

== 2. Split the log line

* Method https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.Split[Split] could be useful here.

== 3. Count the number of lines containing `password` in quoted text

* You can make expression matching case sensitive by prefixing the regular expression with `(?i)`.
This will set the `i` flag.
See https://yourbasic.org/golang/regexp-cheat-sheet/#case-insensitive-and-multiline-matches[this tutorial].

== 4. Remove artifacts from log

* Method https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.ReplaceAllString[ReplaceAllString] could be useful here.

== 5. Tag lines with user names

* Method https://pkg.go.dev/regexp#Regexp.FindStringSubmatch[FindStringSubmatch] could be useful here.
