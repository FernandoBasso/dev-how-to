= Hints

== General

* There are three https://golang.org/ref/spec#Logical_operators[boolean operators] to work with boolean values.
* Multiple operators can be combined in a single expression.

== 1. Check if a fast attack can be made

* The logical NOT operator (`!`) can be placed before an expression to negate its value.

== 2. Check if the group can be spied upon

* Logical operators are typically used to evaluate whether two or more expressions are true or not true.

== 3. Check if the prisoner can be signaled

* Logical operators execute in the order of their precedence (from highest to lowest): `!`, `&&`, `||`.
* For more details check out the Operator Precedence section on the https://golang.org/ref/spec#Operators[official golang documentation] and the https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-boolean-logic-in-go[truth table].
