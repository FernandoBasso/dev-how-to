== Five categories of variables

Ruby has at least five main categories of variables.

- global variables;
- local variables;
- instance variables;
- class variables;
- instance class variables;


=== Global Variables

Global variables identifiers start with the `$` sign. Once defined, they are
visible everywhere in the program.

[source,ruby,lineos]
----
$myvar = 'the force'

def say
  puts $myvar     # Accessible here. <1>
end

class Message
  def say_msg
    puts $myvar   # And here as well. <2>
  end
end

say
Person.new.say_msg
----

<1> The global variable `$myvar` is available inside a method in the “outer scope”.

<2> The global variable `$myvar` is also available to a method that lives inside a class.
