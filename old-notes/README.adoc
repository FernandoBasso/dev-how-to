== Intro

My personal repository of tips, tutorials, ideas, code, solutions and whatever else I see fit to put in here üòÖ.

The idea is to collect everything I research and study in a single place (the exception to this is my math studies which I store somewhere else) so that I can open an editor or perform searches from a single place, instead of trying to remember in which directory I did something.

== Commit Messages

As of May 2022, I'm starting to use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org), always making sure to use a proper commit *type*  and a *scope* (when a *scope* makes sense):

For programming languages, I use the programming language extension as the commit *type*:

- `c` for the C language;
- `rb` for Ruby;
- `js` for JavaScript;
- `ts` for TypeScript;
- `hs` for Haskell;
- `purs` for PureScript;
- `scm` for Scheme;
- `rkt` for Racket Scheme;
- ...and so on and so forth...

For libraries or frameworks I may use a mix of things, or reasonable abbreviations:

- `cmdline`: general shell-related stuff;
- `vim`: guess!
- `emacs`: guess!
- `xfce`: Xfce Linux Window Manager;
- `thunar`: Xfce file manager;

For books or special ‚Äúprojects‚Äù I would have their initials or something minimally identifiable:

- `hffp`: commits related to the book Haskell From First Principles;
- `ckr`: for C K&R book;
- `codewars`: Codewars challenges;
- `hackerrank`: Hakcerrank challenges;

Examples of commits:

```text
ts(ts50): Add l43 promisify example

hffp: Add solution for chapter 10 exercises

vim(fzf): Add fzf text search key binding
```

== Git Setup

Make sure to properly `core.hooksPath` to `.githooks` directory:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks
----

You may want to read the shell scripts inside the `.githooks/` and `scripts/` directories.

=== pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook runs a script to find new or changed `.png` images and runs `optipng` on them so they get optimized (reduced in file size) before being committed to the repository.

=== commit-msg hook

Runs a shell script that checks that our commit messages follows our standards.

=== Helper Script for Commit Types

One idea is to create a script that collects all ‚Äútags‚Äù I have used so far in git commits and try to reuse them consistently instead of making a mess. Hard to avoid the mess, though.

Here's the script:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ git log --format='%s' \
    | grep '^[a-z]\+:' \
    | sed 's/:.\+//' \
    | sort \
    | uniq
add
hffp
repo
wip
----

== One Sentence Per Line

See link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices/#one-sentence-per-line[AsciiDoc Recommended Practices^].

Don‚Äôt wrap text at a fixed column width.
Instead, put each sentence on its own line, a technique called *sentence per line*.
This technique is similar to how you write and organize source code. The result can be spectacular.

Here are some of the advantages of using the sentence per line style:

- It prevents reflows (meaning a change early in the paragraph won‚Äôt cause the remaining lines in the paragraph to reposition).
- You can easily swap sentences.
- You can easily separate or join paragraphs.
- You can comment out sentences or add commentary to them.
- You can spot sentences which are too long or sentences that vary widely in length.
- You can spot redundant (and thus mundane) patterns in your writing.

We picked up this idea from the writing guide in the Neo4j documentation.
However, it seems like the idea dates back a discovery by Buckminster Fuller in the 1930s, who called it link:https://vanemden.wordpress.com/2009/01/01/ventilated-prose/[ventilated prose^].
The technique was also recommended in 2009 by Brandon Rhodes in a blog post about link:https://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/[Semantic Linefeeds^].

It‚Äôs important to note that this technique works because AsciiDoc doesn‚Äôt treat wrapped lines in prose as hard line breaks.
At least, it doesn‚Äôt show up that way to the reader.
The line breaks between contiguous lines of prose will not be visible in the rendered document (i.e., as the reader sees it).
While a single line break doesn‚Äôt appear in the output, two consecutive line breaks starts a new paragraph (or other block).
