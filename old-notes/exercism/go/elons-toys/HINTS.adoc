= Hints

== 1. Drive a car

* Add a field to the `Car` struct that keeps track of the driven distance
* Create a https://tour.golang.org/methods/1[method] that has a receiver of type `Car` and updates the driven distance

== 2. Display the distance driven

* Create a https://tour.golang.org/methods/1[method] that has a receiver of type `Car`
* Show the value of the _distance_ field

== 3. Display the battery percentage

* Create a https://tour.golang.org/methods/1[method] that has a receiver of type `Car`
* Show the value of the _battery_ field

== 4. Check if a remote car can finish a race

* Remember the car has a https://tour.golang.org/methods/1[method] to retrieve the distance it has driven
* Consider what to do when the battery has been drained before reaching the finish line
