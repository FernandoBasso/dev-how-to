== Introduction

AsciiDoc is the best markup language.
It is simpler as Markdown for the simple things, while also offering way more useful, powerful and advanced features if when they are needed.

== Convert Markdown to AsciiDoc

Use kramdown, which is better suited than pandoc as it has more AsciiDoc-sensible options.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ gem install kramdown kramdown-asciidoc

$ for file in ./*.md ; do
    kramdoc \
      --format=GFM \
      --output="${file%.md}.adoc" \
      --wrap=ventilate "$file"
  done

$ rm -vi ./*.md

== Convert AsciiDoc to Markdown

* https://github.com/opendevise/downdoc

In short:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ npx downdoc -o ./intro.md ./intro.adoc
----

== Source Highlighter

Add this attribute to the document:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: <which highlighter to use>
----

As of 2023, the docs currently say for pygments we simply write `pygments`.

image::asciidoctor-source-highlighter-pygments.rb-2023-11-11T14-33-05-612Z.png[Asciidoctor Source Highlighter pygments.rb]

but I got an error with this:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: pygments
----

[source,shell-session]
----
$ asciidoctor ./algds/other/prime_factors/README.adoc
asciidoctor: WARNING: optional gem 'pygments.rb' is not available (reason: cannot load 'pygments'). Functionality disabled.
----

But if I changing to `pygments.rb` works:

[source,text]
----
= My Title
:toc: left
...
:source-highlighter: pygments.rb
----

=== Source Highlighter Not Working

We have observed at times that if `asciidoctor` is installed from a `Gemfile` and `pygments.rb` is installed with `gem install`, it may fail (with no errors) to add the tags around the code tokens.

Installing everything from `Gemfile` and then running `bundle exec asciidoctor file.adoc` worked.


One can preview AsciiDoc rendered document in many ways, including editors, browser extensions, or on Gitlab, Github, and probably other services as well.
