== Intro

The goal of this document is to capture some of the main, important ideas about Go interfaces, some use cases, examples and explanations.

[NOTE]
====
We'll use the terms function and method interchangeably in the following text to avoid being repetitive or too verbose when explaining certain ideas.

For example, instead of saying things like “given a function _or_ method that takes an ``io.Writer``...”, we'll simply say “given a function that takes an ``io.Writer``...”.

== io.Writer

List of some useful types that satisfy the `io.Writer` interface:

=== slog.NewTextHandler()

`slog.NewTextHandler()` takes an `io.Writer` as its first parameter, and `os.Stdout` fits the bill:

[source,go]
----
logger := slog.New(slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, nil))
----
