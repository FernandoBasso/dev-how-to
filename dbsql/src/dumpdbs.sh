# Dumps databases including their DDL code.
#
# NOTE: This is a simple script to dump my study databases. All the DBs
# must belong to the same user and with the the same password.
#
# Usage:
#
#   PGHOST=<host> \
#   PGUSER=<user> \
#   PGPASSWORD=<password> \
#   CONTAINER_NAME=<docker-container-name> \
#   bash dump_dbs.sh
#
# BEWARE: The password will be saved on your shell history. You may
# start the dump command with a space to cause bash to NOT save the
# command to the history, but keep in mind that it depends on some
# bash's configs (should be on by default, though, unless you changed
# it).
#

##
# Keep this array updated with whatever databases need to be backed up
# from time to time.
#
# BEWARE: Even though this is for local, study databases, be careful
# with sensitive information as the dumped DBs are committed to the repo
# as well.
