== Intro

Read about parameter expansion in https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Shell-Parameter-Expansion[Bash Manual] or `PAGER=less man bash` and then do the search `/^ *Parameter Expansion`.

Parameter expansion is used to perform operations on the value stored in the parameter. Read each appropriate section while trying the examples that follow.

NOTE: These expansions require that the value to be manipulated be stored in a variable.

== ${parameter/pattern/string}

Expand the parameter `sentence`, match the pattern `force` and replace it with the string `source`:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ sentence='May the force be with you.'

$ printf '%s\n' "${sentence/force/source}"
May the source be with you.
----

Now compare this with the previous example.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ sentence='May the force be with you.'

$ printf '%s\n' "${sentence/force/source/}"
May the source/ be with you.
----

See the trailing forward slash on ``source''? That is one too many forward slashes. It is not part of the expansion and just copied to the output as a literal character.

The curly braces are required, otherwise, we end up just appending text to the original string:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ printf '%s\n' "$sentence/force/source/"
May the force be with you./force/source/
----

We just appended ``/force/source/'' as literal characters to the value stored in `sentence`.

The expansion `${foo/patt/repl}` is not global â€” it replaces only the first occurrence of `patt`. To replace globally, we use two forward slashes at the beginning of `patt`.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ quixote='What your beauty has raised up your deeds have laid low.'

$ echo "${quixote/your/thy}"
What thy beauty has raised up your deeds have laid low.

$ echo "${quixote//your/thy}"
What thy beauty has raised up thy deeds have laid low.
----

In the first version, only the first ``your'' is replaced with ``thy''. In the second, both are replaced.

=== `#' To Match At The Beginning

We can use `#` as the first character in `pattern` to match at the beginning.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ str='The Apollo Missions'
$ echo "${str/#Apollo/NASA}"
The Apollo Missions
----

No replacement happens because `Apollo` is not at the beginning. This next example does match and replaces.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ str='Apollo Missions'
$ echo "${str/#Apollo/NASA}"
NASA Missions
----

=== `%' To Match At The End

We can use `%` as the first character in `pattern` to match at the end.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ str='Execute order sixty-six.'
$ echo "${str/%sixty-six/66}"
Execute order sixty-six.
----

No match because there is a dot ``.'' at the end of the string so ``sixty-six'' is not really at the end. But this works:

[source,shell-session]
----
$ str='Execute order sixty-six.'
$ echo "${str/%sixty-six./66.}"
Execute order 66.
----

== Replace Expansion

We have a string of numbers separated by spaces. Replace each space `' '` with `' + '`, which would effectively turn the string into a math expression, which could in turn be fed to a program like `bc`.

[source,shell-session]
----
$ nums='1 2 3 4'

$ echo "${nums// / + }"
1 + 2 + 3 + 4

$ echo "${nums// / + }" | bc
10
----

== The End

Really! This is the end of this file.
