== General

This https://gobyexample.com/random-numbers[article] gives a nice introduction to package `math/rand`.

If you are working locally and use Go 1.19 or lower, make sure to seed your random number generator with the current time.

== 1. Roll a die.

This https://yourbasic.org/golang/generate-number-random-range[article] shows how to generate integers in a certain range.

== 2. Generate wand energy.

Function https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand#Float64[rand.Float64] returns a random `float64` number between 0.0 and 1.0.

== 3. Shuffle a slice.

Create a slice with the eight animal strings, then call https://pkg.go.dev/math/rand#Rand.Shuffle[rand.Shuffle] to put it into a random order.
