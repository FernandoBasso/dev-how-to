== Intro

Unless otherwise noted, assume these examples where tested on MySQL and MySQL CLI.
I prefer MariaDB and PostgreSQL by it seems HackerRank does not provide any of those (as of June 18, 2023 at least).

Also, we'll try to stick to standard-compliant (and shy away from vendor-specific features and syntax) SQL whenever possible for max portability.

[NOTE]
====
RackerRank SQL challenges come in three main levels of difficulty:

* Basic
* Intermediate
* Advanced

This page deals with the basic ones.

== Revising The Select Query I

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-the-select-query[Revising the Select Query I :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    id
  , name
  , countrycode
  , district
  , population
FROM city
WHERE population >= 100000
AND countrycode = 'USA';
----

We can replace all column names with the star `*`, but this is more readable as all column names are explicitly stated in the query.

Also, we could use `LIKE` in place of `=` for this case: `â€¦ AND countrycode LIKE 'USA'`.

== Revising the Select Query II

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/revising-the-select-query-2[Revising the Select Query II :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE population > 120000
AND countrycode LIKE 'USA';
----

== Select All

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-all-sql[Select All :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    id
  , name
  , countrycode
  , district
  , population
FROM city;
----

Again, writing the column names explicitly makes it more self-documenting than simply using `*`.

== Select By ID

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/select-by-id[Select By ID :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    id
  , name
  , countrycode
  , district
  , population
FROM city
WHERE id = 1661;
----

== Japanese Cities' Attributes

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/japanese-cities-attributes[Japanese Cities' Attributes :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT name
FROM city
WHERE countrycode = 'JPN';
----

== Weather Observation Station 1

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-1[Weather Observation Station 1 :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    city
  , state
FROM station;
----

== Weather Observation Station 2

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-2[Weather Observation Station 2 :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

----
SELECT
    ROUND(SUM(lat_n), 2) AS lat
  , ROUND(SUM(long_w), 2) AS lon
FROM station;
----

So we basically round the result of the sum and rename the output columns as `lat` and `lon`.

We can `SUM` any numeric column, e.g.:

----
SELECT SUM(id) FROM users;
----

And also `ROUND(value, num_decimal_places)`, e.g.:

----
mydb=# SELECT ROUND(3.141592653589793, 5) AS my_pi;
  my_pi
---------
 3.14159
----

== Weather Observation Station 3

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-3[Weather Observation Station 3 :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE id % 2 = 0;
----

We just `SELECT DISTINCT` to avoid duplicates.

For the "`even IDs`", the old, battle-tested tested integer division compared with 0 does the trick.
It seems `%` has higher precedence than `=`, but we could wrap the remainder division in parentheses too if we wanted to make sure or make it more explicit/clear:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE (id % 2) = 0;
----

== Weather Observation Station 4

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-4[Weather Observation Station 4 :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

[source,sql]
----
SELECT (COUNT(city) - COUNT(DISTINCT city)) AS count
FROM station;
----

Looks like they consider only the city name (`city`) column to determine if the city is the same or not.

`COUNT(city)` returns some number, and `COUNT(DISTINCT city)` can potentially return another number, which we subtract from the first, producing the correct result expected by the challenge.

Note we didn't call `DISTINCT` as a function, with parentheses, like `DISTINCT(city)`.

Assume this table and data:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
  , name VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (
    id
  , name
) VALUES
    (1, 'Yoda')
  , (2, 'Ahsoka tano')
  , (3, 'Aayla Secura')
  , (4, 'Leia')
  , (5, 'Leia');
----

Then see how it is possible to use both `DISTINCT name` or `DISTINCT(name)` inside `COUNT()`:

[,text]
----
> SELECT id, name FROM users;
 id |     name
----+--------------
  1 | Yoda
  2 | Ahsoka tano
  3 | Aayla Secura
  4 | Leia
  5 | Leia
(5 rows)

> SELECT COUNT(name) FROM users;
 count
-------
     5
(1 row)

                 parentheses
               --------------
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(name)) FROM users;
 count
-------
     4
(1 row)

               no parentheses
               -------------
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM users;
 count
-------
     4
(1 row)

                                parentheses
                              --------------
> SELECT (COUNT(name) - COUNT(DISTINCT(name))) AS count FROM users;
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)

                              no parentheses
                              -------------
> SELECT (COUNT(name) - COUNT(DISTINCT name)) AS count FROM users;
 count
-------
     1
(1 row)
----

I tested this on both PostgreSQL and MariaDB and both vendors accept both syntaxes.

== Weather Observation Station 6

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-6[Weather Observation Station 6 :: HackerRank SQL Challenge].

Works on DB vendors whose collation allows case insensitive matches:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT city
FROM station
WHERE
     city LIKE 'a%'
  OR city LIKE 'e%'
  OR city LIKE 'i%'
  OR city LIKE 'o%'
  OR city LIKE 'u%';
----

This approach extracts the first char of the `title` column and uses `IN` to compare.
It relies on the fact that cities start with an uppercase letter:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM entries
WHERE
  SUBSTR(title, 1, 1)
  IN('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U');
----

And this one, similar to the above, just lowercases the first char of the title before doing the comparison:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT DISTINCT title
FROM entries
WHERE
  LOWER(SUBSTR(title, 1, 1))
  IN('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u');
----

== Weather Observation Station 5

* https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/weather-observation-station-5[Weather Observation Station 5 :: HackerRank Easy SQL Challenge]

=== UNION ALL of two queries

One approach is to use two queries: one for the city name length, and another one for the min city name length, limit by 1, and union the results to create a single resulting tabular structure:

[source,sql]
----
(SELECT
    city
  ,  LENGTH(city) AS len_city
FROM station
ORDER BY len_city ASC, city DESC
LIMIT 1)
UNION ALL
(SELECT
    city
  , LENGTH(city) AS len_city
FROM station
ORDER BY len_city DESC, city DESC
LIMIT 1);
----

=== WHERE IN union of subquery

Or creating a sub-table to select the lengths from.

First, select the max and min lengths:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT MAX(LENGTH(city)) FROM station
UNION ALL
SELECT MIN(LENGTH(city)) FROM station;
----

It returns a tabular structures with the max and min lengths, which can be used in a `WHEER/IN` clause:

[source,sql]
----
SELECT
    city
  , LENGTH(city)
FROM station
WHERE LENGTH(city) IN (
  SELECT MAX(LENGTH(city)) FROM station
  UNION ALL
  SELECT MIN(LENGTH(city)) FROM station
)
ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city;
----
