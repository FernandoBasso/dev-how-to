= if and unless modifiers


1. http://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/programming_books/ruby_tutorial/Ruby_Expressions_If_and_Unless_Modifiers.html


Ruby shares a neat feature with Perl. Statement modifiers let you tack
conditional statements onto the end of a normal statement.

    mon, day, year = $1, $2, $3 if /(\d\d)-(\d\d)-(\d\d)/
    puts "a = #{a}" if fDebug
    print total unless total == 0

For an if modifier, the preceding expression will be evaluated only if the
condition is true. unless works the other way around.

    while gets
      next if /^#/            # Skip comments
      parseLine unless /^$/   # Don't parse empty lines
    end

Because if itself is an expression, you can get really obscure with statements
such as:

    if artist == "John Coltrane"
      artist = "'Trane"
    end unless nicknames == "no"

This path leads to the gates of madness.
