Book The Joy of Abstraction by Eugenia Cheng.

Then they mentioned Category Theory for Programmers by Bartosz Milewski:
- [[https://www.blurb.com/b/9621951-category-theory-for-programmers-new-edition-hardco][Category Theory for Programmers (New Edition, Hardcover)]]
- [[https://www.youtube.com/@DrBartosz/playlists][Bartosz videos on the topic]]

The book and videos are probably based on the [[https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/][original blog series on
category theory]].
