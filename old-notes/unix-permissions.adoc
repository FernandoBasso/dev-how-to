= Unix and Linux Permission

== External USB Drive

You have an external USB drive that you use to backup files across multiple Linux instalations, where your UID changes for each one.

----
sudo groupadd --gid 2001 bkpfiles
sudo gpasswd --add "$USER" bkpfiles
# logout/login or reboot
----

Then do this on your external EXT4 partition:

----
sudo chgrp --recursive --verbose bkpfiles /media/fernando.basso/YOUR_EXT4_DRIVE
----

Now you should be able to rwx on that partition from different users with different UIDs on different *nix machines.
