= Symbols

A symbol is a label used to identify a piece of data.
A symbol is only stored in memory one time.

    'foo'.object_id # A certain id.
    'foo'.object_id # A different id than the previous one.
    :foo.object_id  # A certain id.
    :foo.object_id  # The same id as the one above.

Useful with hashes:

    person1 = { :name => 'Foo' }
    person2 = { :name => 'Bar' }
    person3 = { :name => 'Bazinga' }

`:name` is only created and stored in memory once. It is good for memory.
