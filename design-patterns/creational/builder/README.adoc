== The Builder creational pattern

The builder patterns helps construct complex objects without having to explicitly instantiate its values or writing the entire logic they require.
And we don't want to force consumers of those objects to have to do all that setup.

Object creation can be really simple, with default values, or complex if an object needs results from network requests, state checks, create nested objects for certain fields, etc.
