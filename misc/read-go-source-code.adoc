== Intro

The “finger pointer” symbol “󰆽” indicates where the cursor is on the editor when issuing the navigation commands.

Most editor and IDEs nowadas (as of 2024) use the Language Server Protocol to provide language and project intellisense.
We'll use generic names for the actions that cause the editor/IDE to move to some other symbol.

== Interfaces, structs and methods

From an interface definition, we can “go to implementations”.

[source,go]
====
type Player interface {
//     󰆽
}
====

This should take us to the struct receivers that implement the interface.

Then from the struct, we can move to its references.

Also, from an interface method, we can navigate from all the concrete implementation of that method.
